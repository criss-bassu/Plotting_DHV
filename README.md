# Data Visualization Assignment

This repository contains solutions for the **Data Visualization Assignment**, which consists of two problems. The solutions showcase Python-based data visualization using NumPy and pandas, leveraging creative and high-quality presentations of artificial and real datasets.

## Problem 1: Creating an Artificial Data Set and Visualizing It

In this problem, we:

✅ Generated at least 300 random data points using a NumPy random number generator (distribution of choice).  
✅ Created a histogram of the generated data.  
✅ Added annotations to indicate the **mean** and **median** of the distribution.  

**Key elements of good style included:**
- Appropriate axis ranges and scaling.
- Labeled and legible axes with font size 14 for both labels and tick marks.
- Optimized line thicknesses for clarity.
- Thoughtful color scheme.
- Clear, legible annotations.

## Problem 2: Loading and Visualizing Data from a Parquet File

In this problem, we:

✅ Loaded data from a provided Parquet file.  
✅ Created elegant and insightful plots to fully present the data, aiming for clarity and creativity.  
✅ Explored multiple ways to visualize the data to uncover patterns and insights.  

**Approach Highlights:**
- Used `pandas` for data loading and handling.
- Created multiple plots where necessary to showcase different aspects of the dataset.
- Focused on visual appeal and informative presentation.
